# 🚀 Automated Sales Performance Dashboard (Excel VBA)
## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a fully automated Sales Performance Reporting System built using Microsoft Excel VBA.

It processes raw sales transaction data, identifies performance gaps, generates employee-level summaries, and automatically creates an executive dashboard with KPIs and charts.

The entire workflow runs with a single macro execution.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Organizations often manage monthly sales data manually using filters and pivot tables. This leads to:

- Time-consuming reporting

- Manual formatting effort

- Risk of human error

- Lack of automation

- Inconsistent reporting structure

#### Managers need:

- Underperformer identification

- Employee-wise total sales

- Executive-level KPIs

- Visual dashboard summary

- Automated report generation

## 💡 Solution

Built an automation system using Excel VBA that:

✔ Loops through 100+ records

✔ Identifies sales below target

✔ Applies conditional row formatting

✔ Aggregates employee-wise total sales

✔ Generates a Summary sheet

✔ Sorts employees by performance

✔ Creates KPI metrics automatically

✔ Builds a dynamic Top 10 employee chart

✔ Handles errors gracefully
